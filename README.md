# Pretraining

## Data Preprocessing Code:

**mdd_preprocessing.py** - used to preprocessing MDD data

## Model Training Code:

**sleep_train_conference_final.py** - contains the code for training the Model S sleep models that were later used in mdd_pretrained_conference_final.py

**mdd_pretrain_conference_final.py** - contains the code for training MDD Models A through D

## Performance Analysis Code:

**mdd_pretrain_performance_analysis_conference_final.ipynb** - used to perform statistical analysis comparing MDD models performance

## Explainability Code:

**mdd_pretrain_explainability_conference_final.py** - used to generate spatial and spectral explanations for MDD Models A through D

**mdd_pretrain_visualize_explainability_conference_final.ipynb** - used to visualize spatial and spectral explainability results
